- **Profile Details**: Fetch detailed information about a GitHub user's profile.
- **Redirection**: Directly access the user's GitHub profile through the app.
- **Implementation of API Fetching**: Demonstrates the usage of API fetching techniques.
- **Promises in JavaScript**: Utilizes JavaScript promises for asynchronous operations.

## How to Use

1. Enter a GitHub username in the search bar.
2. Click "Search" to fetch the user's profile details.
3. Explore the fetched data, followers and repositories.
4. Click "Github Profile" to redirect to the user's GitHub profile page.

## Technologies Used

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
